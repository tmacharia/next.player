# Next.player [![Generic Build](https://github.com/tmacharia/next.player/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tmacharia/next.player/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

Open source development of a player for local media files on a computer with advanced configurations
and rich metadata aggregation.

The story of this project comes from a personal app that I had created for playing local media files. 

Looking for contributors.

Would you like to contribute?
